# KAFFEINE - A Coffee Ordering Android App

KAFFEINE is a modern, feature-rich Android application designed for coffee lovers. It provides a seamless experience for browsing a menu of popular coffees, managing a shopping cart, and placing orders. The app is built with a focus on a clean, intuitive user interface and leverages the power of Firebase for its backend services.
